This is a program written in C++ to help a rental boat company keep track of their boat rentals for the week. 


Background:
In the summers I used to work on at a rental company on Lake Winnipesaukee who kept all of their rentals on paper in a binder. We often ran into trouble with double booking people or losing customer information. I always had the thought that it would be so much easier for them if there was a system online that they could put the customer information in and check to see what boats are available. So this is what I made to try to prevent all of this human error. 


Program walkthrough:
The program starts off with asking if a normal motorboat or a pontoon is being rented. After this has been decided, you enter the day of the week the boat is being rented on. Then the program tells you what boats are available for that day and what the price is. If you decide to book one of these boats you get an automatic message that it has been booked. Then it prompts for customer information (name, number) and asks if you want to input any more rentals. You can keep inputting all of the rentals for the week and the program will not let you double book multiple people on the same boat during the same time frame. At the end, an output file will be generated detailing all of the customers and their information for safe keeping.
